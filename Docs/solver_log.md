Model:

<br>

6 rows x 7 cols = 42 total states
<br>

Possible actions ---> 7 (action = selected column)
<br>

Reward given only if the robot wins the game
<br>

Possible winning directions from a given state ---> 5 <br>
Check for a win from given state (row and col):

+ function parameters state row and col
+ Loop for (r) ---> -3 to 0
+ loop for (c) ---> -3 to 3
+ count++ if (r and c both are NOT = 0) and (row and col are within model boundries) and (row + r and col + c == true)
<br>

(MAYBE???) Current state to be defined in full (current) sequence of the game in either 1 to 42 states or row and col (eg 1,1;4,2;7,1)

+ Look into OPEN AI GYM (advised by Dr Gianni)
 - looks great but has some issues
 - GYM has removed game board enviornments in the new version
 - Also only available in python, which is fine but i will need to investigate sockets first

+ Look up state against frequency of actions used against it (advised by Dr Gianni)
 - Looks like Partially Observable Markov's Decision Process (POMDP)
